In this project, a model for predicting house prices has been created using regression.
# House Price Prediction in Tehran

This project uses linear regression to predict house prices in Tehran based on apartment features such as area, number of rooms, parking availability, warehouse availability, and address.

## Dataset

The dataset, sourced from "Apartments_information.csv", contains information about apartments in Tehran with the following columns:
- **Area**: Apartment area in square meters (initially string, converted to float).
- **Room**: Number of rooms (integer).
- **Parking**: Availability of parking (True/False).
- **Warehouse**: Availability of a warehouse (True/False).
- **Elevator**: Availability of an elevator (True/False).
- **Address**: Apartment address (categorical, later encoded).
- **Price**: Price in local currency (float).
- **Price(USD)**: Price in USD (float).

Initial size: 3479 rows; after preprocessing: 3452 rows.

## Preprocessing

- Loaded the dataset from "Apartments_information.csv".
- Dropped rows with missing values (23 rows dropped initially, then 4 more after `Area` conversion).
- Converted `Area` from string to float, replacing commas with dots.
- Assumed log transformations for `Area` and `Price` (as `Area_log` and `Price_log`) to handle skewness.
- Applied target encoding to `Address` within cross-validation, using the mean `Price_log` per address from training data.

## Model

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`)
- **Features**: 
  - `Room`
  - `Area_log`
  - `Parking`
  - `Warehouse`
  - `Address_encoded`
- **Target**: `Price_log`
- **Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation (`KFold`, `shuffle=True`, `random_state=42`)

## Results

- **R² Scores**:
  - Fold 1: 0.854
  - Fold 2: 0.875
  - Fold 3: 0.837
  - Fold 4: 0.857
  - Fold 5: 0.856
  - **Average R²**: 0.856

- **MSE Scores**:
  - Fold 1: 0.164
  - Fold 2: 0.142
  - Fold 3: 0.183
  - Fold 4: 0.172
  - Fold 5: 0.169
  - **Average MSE**: 0.166

### Interpretation

- The model explains ~85.6% of the variance in `Price_log` (R² = 0.856), indicating a strong fit.
- The MSE of 0.166 on the log scale suggests reasonable prediction accuracy.
- A Pearson correlation of 0.81 between `Area` and `Price` highlights a strong positive relationship, visualized in the scatter plot below:

## Usage

To run the code:
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`).
2. Place "Apartments_information.csv" in the working directory.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook (`House_price_prediction.ipynb`).
